# Backend Logging System Implementation - Summary

## Problem Statement
The chaiNNer backend had issues with logging:
1. All logging was done by the frontend, so backend logs were lost if the frontend crashed
2. No persistent log files for backend processes
3. Log timestamps had only 1-second precision, making it difficult to correlate events across processes
4. Dependency on Sanic's logger API which had incorrect usage issues

## Solution Implemented

### New Logging Module (`backend/src/logger.py`)
Created a centralized logging system with the following features:

1. **Separate Log Files**
   - `host.log` - Logs from the host process
   - `worker.log` - Logs from the worker process
   - Both stored in the same directory for easy correlation

2. **Improved Timestamp Precision**
   - Millisecond-precision timestamps: `2025-10-19 05:55:47.606`
   - Much better than the previous 1-second precision
   - Makes it easy to correlate events across processes

3. **File-Based Logging**
   - Logs persist to disk independently of the frontend
   - Default location: `/tmp/chaiNNer/logs/` (or OS temp directory)
   - Can be customized via `log_dir` parameter

4. **Log Rotation**
   - Automatic rotation at 10MB per file
   - Keeps last 5 rotated files
   - Prevents unbounded disk usage

5. **Colored Console Output**
   - ANSI color codes for better readability
   - DEBUG=Cyan, INFO=Green, WARNING=Yellow, ERROR=Red, CRITICAL=Magenta

6. **Better API**
   - Standard Python logging interface
   - Replaces Sanic's custom logger
   - Type-safe with proper type hints

### API Usage

```python
# For host process
from logger import get_logger
logger = get_logger("host")
logger.info("Message")

# For worker process
from logger import get_logger
logger = get_logger("worker")
logger.info("Message")

# For shared code (auto-detects process type)
from logger import get_logger_from_env
logger = get_logger_from_env()
logger.info("Message")
```

## Files Changed

### New Files
1. `backend/src/logger.py` - Core logging module (162 lines)
2. `backend/tests/test_logger.py` - Comprehensive unit tests (109 lines)
3. `backend/LOGGING.md` - Documentation (170 lines)
4. `backend/demo_logging.py` - Demo script (84 lines)

### Modified Files (53 files)
Updated all imports from `from sanic.log import logger` to use the new logger:

**Core Backend:**
- `backend/src/server.py` - Worker process entry point
- `backend/src/server_host.py` - Host process entry point
- `backend/src/server_process_helper.py` - Worker process helper
- `backend/src/api/api.py` - API module
- `backend/src/api/settings.py`
- `backend/src/process.py`
- `backend/src/gpu.py`
- `backend/src/chain/cache.py`
- `backend/src/chain/optimize.py`

**Packages (44 files):**
- chaiNNer_pytorch (10 files)
- chaiNNer_onnx (8 files)
- chaiNNer_ncnn (4 files)
- chaiNNer_standard (4 files)
- chaiNNer_external (2 files)
- Node implementations (16 files)

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Created comprehensive tests in `backend/tests/test_logger.py`:
- `test_logger_setup()` - Verifies logger configuration and file creation
- `test_get_logger()` - Tests logger retrieval
- `test_separate_process_types()` - Verifies separate logging for host/worker

All tests pass: **12/12 tests passing**

### Manual Testing
1. Verified logger module imports correctly
2. Ran demo script successfully
3. Verified log files are created in correct location
4. Verified logs can be sorted and correlated by timestamp
5. Verified colored console output works

### Linting
- All new code passes Ruff linting
- No new linting errors introduced
- Code formatted according to project standards

## Example Output

### Console Output (with colors):
```
[05:55:47] [4157] [INFO] Host process starting up
[05:55:47] [4157] [INFO] Starting worker process
[05:55:47] [4157] [INFO] Worker process initialized
[05:55:47] [4157] [WARNING] Some node had an issue
[05:55:47] [4157] [ERROR] Error during execution: Something went wrong!
```

### Log File Output:
```
2025-10-19 05:55:47.606 [4157] [INFO] Host process starting up
2025-10-19 05:55:47.607 [4157] [INFO] Starting worker process
2025-10-19 05:55:47.707 [4157] [INFO] Worker process initialized
2025-10-19 05:55:47.707 [4157] [WARNING] Some node had an issue
2025-10-19 05:55:47.807 [4157] [ERROR] Error during execution: Something went wrong!
```

### Combined Logs (sorted):
```bash
cat /tmp/chaiNNer/logs/host.log /tmp/chaiNNer/logs/worker.log | sort
```

## Benefits

1. **Persistence** - Logs survive frontend crashes
2. **Correlation** - Easy to correlate events across processes with ms precision
3. **Debuggability** - Separate files but same directory makes debugging easier
4. **Maintainability** - Standard Python logging API instead of Sanic's custom logger
5. **Disk Management** - Automatic log rotation prevents unbounded growth
6. **Usability** - Colored console output for better readability

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing code continues to work
- No changes to external APIs
- All existing tests pass
- Log format is standard and human-readable

## Next Steps (Optional Future Enhancements)

1. Add configurable log levels via command-line arguments
2. Add structured logging (JSON format) for machine parsing
3. Add log streaming to frontend via SSE
4. Add metrics/statistics gathering
5. Add log archival/compression for old logs

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully addresses all the issues raised in the problem statement:
- ✅ Backend logs persist independently of frontend
- ✅ Better than 1-second precision for correlation
- ✅ Separate log files for host and worker
- ✅ Better API than Sanic's logger
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Comprehensive testing and documentation
